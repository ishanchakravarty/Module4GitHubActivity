There once was a famous basketball player who lived in San Francisco, California. 
He was happily married to Zendaya and had two daughters together. 
Recently, he signed a NBA contract with the Golden State Warriors for 100 million dollars. 
Zendaya also began to receive many offers for new movies and TV shows.
The family began to look for a new house because of their financial stability.
The couple had so much money that they did not know how to spend it! - ISHAN

They decided that the best house that they could buy would be one that was made of gold.
This turned out to not be a very good idea since gold is not very durable and as soon as it was built it
collapsed, killing all of the construction workers. Zendaya and the basketball players were then haunted by the
golden ghosts of a hundred construction workers which was not very fun. - CONNOR

They realized that life isn't meant for bragging about monetary luxuries, and having gotten over their superficial
nature, they decided to get a cosy, minimalistic house. Furthermore, they decided to support the families of 
all the construction workers whose lives had come to a tragic end while building their mansion. As the family's 
journey to become sincere citizens of the world progressed, the ghosts haunting them disappeared, and they
lived their modest lives happily ever after. - AABHA
